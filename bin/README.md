About Building Maintainable Software
-----------

This assigment code is based (we pruned the original) on the example code that accompanies _Building Maintainable Software: Ten Guidelines for Future-Proof Code_ by Joost Visser.

There are currently two editions of _Building Maintainable Software_:
- The Java edition (ISBN print: 978-1-4919-5352-5, ISBN eBook: 978-1-4919-5348-8), available [at the O'Reilly webshop](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920049159.do) and [at Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Building-Maintainable-Software-Java-Edition-ebook/dp/B01B6WS86I).
- The C# edition (ISBN print: 978-1-4919-5452-2, ISBN eBook: 978-1-4919-5448-5), available [at the O'Reilly webshop](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920049555.do) and [at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Maintainable-Software-Guidelines-Future-Proof-ebook/dp/B01GSRN582).

[Training videos](http://oreil.ly/1OVw1PM) are also available via O'Reilly Media.

Both editions are the same except for the language of the code snippets and a bit of language-specific terminology (e.g., 'Eclipse' in the Java edition is 'Visual Studio' in the C# edition).
